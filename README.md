# Simple Bank Account Management System

This is a simple Bank Account Management System developed to demonstrate the key concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java. The system allows users to create accounts, deposit money, withdraw money, and check balances.

## OOP Concepts Demonstrated

- **Classes and Objects**: Modeling accounts as objects with attributes and behaviors.
- **Inheritance**: Using a base class (`BankAccount`) and specialized subclasses (`SavingsAccount`, `CurrentAccount`).
- **Polymorphism**: Implementing method overriding for account-specific behaviors.
- **Encapsulation**: Protecting data with private attributes and public accessors.
